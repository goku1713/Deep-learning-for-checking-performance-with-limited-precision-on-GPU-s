# Deep-learning-for-checking-performance-with-limited-precision-on-GPU-s
This project is about deep learning to check the GPU's performace for various precision levels of data types. This project includes keras library at the back end to perform complex calculations.





to test on various dataTypes 
 Just use the tf.cast and change the dataType precision from float 16 to 32 or 64
